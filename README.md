# Hello worldðŸ‘‹ I'm Nikolai - aka malanka96:muscle:
> Samurai has no purpose, only the way...

## Front-end developer. 

I started to learn on my own - from the resource [learn.javascript.ru](https://learn.javascript.ru/).
Then I began to master the ***React*** library for writing web applications and the ***Redux*** library for managing the state of the application.

### At the moment I am a member of the development team of one startup :rocket:

I have experience in teamwork, as well as experience in creating SPA using:
  - JS (ES6) / TS
  - React
  - Redux toolkit 
  - HTML
  - CSS

### My sandbox app ReDr :pencil2:
